# Dallas Guitar Repair - Prototype (2016)

- Client: Dallas Guitar Repair
- Agency: Boots
- Design: Boots
- Development: Boots

This is a static HTML version of a website I built for Dallas Guitar Repair. I built it as a gift for a friend of mine, but he actually never accepted it.  The content is from his website at the time, I just tried to present it in a better way. This website was never "live".

This website is for my personal portfolio only.
